### General info:
This application uses a deep neural network for image classification. The idea was to code a DNN solely from scratch to gain a deeper understanding of DNNs. Hence, no libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch required.

### Version:
This app was coded in Python 3.

### Packages:
To be able to run this project in Python you will need to install the following packages:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- h5py

### Setup:
To run this project, install it locally.
IMPORTANT: Make sure you include your image data in a sub-folder named 'data' within the parent directory!
Likely you want (at least) two separate files within the 'data' folder. One that includes your training data and one that includes your test data.

### Current status:
Done. However, fine-tuning of hyperparameters would improve performance.
